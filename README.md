# CCTVplexer

This is a work in progress and is specifically for the Raspbery pi.

The config.cfg file is the key. You can define your cameras here and various views of the cameras.

At the moment you switch views using the keys 0-9 and hit q to quit.

# Future Plans

1. Integration with CEC so that you can change views etc using your TV remote control
2. Integration with lircd so you can other remotes
3. Control of PTZs
